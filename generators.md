# Generators

For now, this list is comprised of generators built alongside Skeleton Scene. However, over time, I hope to see the list expand to include generators other people have created.

## In progress

The following generators are considered incomplete, but are being worked on.

### [Snowflake](https://github.com/mrjackdavis/skeleton-scene-generator-fractal)

Originally named `fractal generator`, Snowflake was the first to be created. The term Snowflake was coined by Nicola Livingstone. Snowflake generates a relatively abstract, artistic interpretation of any type of data.

## Todo

These generators are merely concepts for the moment. Development has not yet begun.

### Colour analyzer

This generator would return the colour data of the input in graph format. This would work best for images, and perhaps websites.

### Songify

Songify would turn the input into an abstract song. Input would determine key, tempo and notes.

### Toast

'Toast' a website by burning a screenshot of it into bread.
