# Generators

For now, this list is comprised of generators built alongside Skeleton Scene. However, over time, I hope to see the list expand to include generators other people have created.

## In progress

The following generators are considered incomplete, but are being worked on.

### [Fractal](https://github.com/mrjackdavis/skeleton-scene-generator-fractal)

The fractal generator was the first to be created. There are many fractals one can create, so I expect this to get a more specific name later on. It is intended to create a very abstract image, not particularly related to the input. Just a representation of it.

## Todo

These generators are merely concepts for the moment. Development has not yet begun.

### Colour analyzer

This generator would return the colour data of the input in graph format. This would work best for images, and perhaps websites.

### Songify

Songify would turn the input into an abstract song. Input would determine key, tempo and notes.
