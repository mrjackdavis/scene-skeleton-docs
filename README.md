# Skeleton Scene

Skeleton scene is an app that gives people the ability to experience their data, any data, in various ways.

These experiences are generated using a **generator**. A **generator** is a standalone program that ingests data and creates an audio, visual or other experience.

Generators communicate with the [Skeleton Scene API](https://github.com/mrjackdavis/skeleton-scene-api); which in turn, is used by the [Skeleton Scene Web App](https://github.com/mrjackdavis/skeleton-scene-app-web) to relay information to users *on the line*.

A list of generators can be [found here](https://github.com/mrjackdavis/scene-skeleton-docs/blob/master/generators.md).
