# What is this?

Skeleton scene is an app that gives people the ability to experience their data, any data, in various ways.

These experiences are generated using a **generator**. A **generator** is a standalone program that ingests data and creates an audio, visual or other experience.

These generators are orchestrated by the main Skeleton Scene app, which will live *on the line*.
